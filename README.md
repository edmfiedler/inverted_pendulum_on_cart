This project outlines the control of an inverted pendulum on a cart.
This is a common problem used in control theory as it is a simple yet
under-actuated system. Demonstrated will be the system, the deriva-
tion of its equations of motion, how this is linearised and represented
in state-space, the application of a LQR-based control, and its perfor-
mance.

To run the MATLAB code, simply run Simulate.m and all the dependent files will be run as well.
